## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that maintain high performance under challenging acoustic conditions. Building upon state-of-the-art models like Whisper and Wav2Vec2, we implement novel techniques to enhance noise robustness and reduce hallucination artifacts in speech transcription.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Noise Robustness**: Enhance ASR performance in noisy environments (traffic, crowds, wind)
- **Hallucination Mitigation**: Detect and reduce false transcriptions in silence/low-signal regions
- **Real-world Applicability**: Deploy production-ready solutions for various use cases
- **Research Contribution**: Advance the field with novel evaluation metrics and techniques

## 🔬 Current Research Focus

### 1. **Dynamic Noise Adaptation** 🔊
- Implementing adaptive attention mechanisms for noise-aware processing
- Developing curriculum learning strategies for progressive noise exposure
- Creating comprehensive noise taxonomy for systematic evaluation

### 2. **Hallucination Detection & Prevention** 🧠
- Building confidence-based detection systems for phantom transcriptions
- Investigating temporal consistency patterns in model outputs
- Developing real-time validation mechanisms

## 📊 Preliminary Results

| Noise Condition | Baseline Whisper | Target Improvement |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Clean Speech   | 2.1% WER         | **< 2.0% WER**   |
| Urban Traffic  | 23.7% WER        | **< 18% WER**    |
| Café Ambient   | 15.4% WER        | **< 12% WER**    |
| Wind Noise     | 31.2% WER        | **< 25% WER**    |
